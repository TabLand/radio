Radio Recording / Subscription via cron and bash

I'm about to retire my current phone, and lose access to a convenient FM Tuner chip as a result.
This project is an attempt to reliably download Live FM radio, and sync it to my new device for offline listening .

I hope this shouldn't cause any legal issues because:
- No license is required to listen to the radio
- There are devices already in the market that allow recording of radio to SD card / HDD etc
- Sky TV allows recording of available FM / DAB radio with no listed end date
- BBC Radio allows downloading of pre-broadcasted audio in non DRM mp3 format, unlike iPlayer recordings which have DRM and strict expiry dates
- I won't be making my recordings publicly available
